# 👋 Hi, I'm Maryam!

I'm a Software Engineering graduate transitioning into **Machine Learning** and **Applied AI** with a focus on building real-world intelligent systems using **Python**.

🔍 I’m currently working on:
- Supervised learning models (Linear & Logistic Regression)
- Data analysis with Pandas & NumPy
- Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Model evaluation and performance tracking

📁 Projects:
- **Student Performance Predictor**: Built using logistic regression to classify exam success based on academic metrics.
- More coming soon (NLP, classification, and recommendation systems)

🎓 I’ve also contributed to research in ML-related domains such as:
- Neural networks
- IoT-based health monitoring
- Blockchain for smart grid security

📍 I'm actively seeking **Machine Learning internships** — remote, Lahore-based, or UAE-based.
